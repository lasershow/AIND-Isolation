## A brief summary of the paper's goals or techniques introduced.

### Goal summary
Goal in this paper is to master Go with artificial intelligence.

### techniques introduced summary
Goal in this paper is to master Go with artificial intelligence.
For that purpose, this paper proposes two deep neural networks.(`value networks/policy network`)

These networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement
learning from games of self-play.

And introduced `combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks.`

## A brief summary of the paper's results.

Using this search algorithm,
our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go
champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the
full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.
